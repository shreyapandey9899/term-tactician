# **LegalEase: Generative AI for Demystifying Legal Documents**

---

## **Overview**

Legal documents are complex, filled with jargon, and often inaccessible to non-lawyers. **LegalEase** leverages Generative AI to simplify, explain, and interact with legal contracts, agreements, and policies—empowering users to understand, negotiate, and manage their obligations with confidence.

**This project is part of the [GenAI Hack2Skill] initiative**, showcasing innovative applications of Generative AI.

## **💡 Key Features**

1. **Interactive Risk Map**

   * Visual, clickable mind map of the document
   * Color-coded clauses: green (safe), yellow (noteworthy), red (high-risk)
   * Click any node for a plain-language explanation

2. **“What If?” Scenario Simulator**

   * Ask hypothetical questions about contract terms
   * AI generates grounded answers using the document content
   * Example: “What happens if I break this lease 6 months early?”

3. **DocuDuel (Contract Comparison)**

   * Upload two contracts → side-by-side comparison of key clauses
   * Judge’s Verdict summary: highlights favorable terms

4. **Negotiation Copilot**

   * Suggests fairer alternatives for unfavorable clauses
   * Generates ready-to-send emails for negotiation

5. **DutyGuard (Obligation & Calendar Sync)**

   * Extracts deadlines, payment terms, and obligations
   * Syncs key dates to Google/Outlook Calendar

6. **GeoLegal Lens (Jurisdiction Validation)**

   * Validates clauses against local laws
   * Flags illegal/unenforceable terms per jurisdiction

## **Architecture Flow**

**1. Front-End Layer (User Interaction)**

* Upload document → sent to backend
* Ask questions → input routed to AI
* View results → interactive visualizations

**2. Back-End Layer (Application Logic)**

* Route requests → direct to appropriate AI service
* Process document → extract clauses, obligations
* Generate responses → summaries, comparisons, scenario answers

**3. Data Layer (Storage & Retrieval)**

* Store documents, embeddings, and user interactions
* Vector DB for RAG → ground AI responses
* Calendar & user metadata storage

**4. AI Layer (Generative Intelligence)**

* Gemini LLM → summarization, rewriting, scenario simulation
* Document AI → OCR and clause extraction
* Multi-modal analysis → Snap-a-Clause feature (photo input)
